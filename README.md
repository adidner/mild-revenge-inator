# mild-revenge-inator

## NOTE: this is mean as an experiment and joke and should not be used to cause people harm in any fashion

## Purpose and idea

 The purpose of this script is to enter a phone number and/or email as well as a name and have said person signed up for a myriad of news letters, pyramid schemes and used car offers.

 This is meant to be mildly annoying as the pranked person will recieve an increase in spam emails and spam phone calls while ultimately being harmless in the grand scheme of things

 This is inspired by one of my ex's who cheated on me the though that it would have been funny to sign them up for spam while in the anger and frustration that comes with being cheated on


 ## Running this Script

 To run this script install python https://www.python.org/downloads/

 Then run main.py from your terminal of choice
